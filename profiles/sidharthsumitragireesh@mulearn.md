# Sidharth Sumitra Gireesh

### About Me

Hi everyone,I am an engineering student named Sidharth Sumitra Gireesh currently pursuing my academic endeavors at the Mar Baselios College of Engineering and Technology; my interest goes towards AI and robotics and comes up with fresh, innovative technical solutions. It's built firmly in Python, C, MySQL, and system development. I have also been active outside the class—serving as the Secretary of the Quiz Club at Arya Central School, researching MOOC courses in order to get ahead of the game, and going deep into areas such as financial management, marketing, and strategy.

Whatever it is – writing code, leading teams, or planning market strategies – I love every process.



#### Leadership and Influence:

I have always exhibited leadership and influence within my field through a mix of strategic vision, team coordination, and initiative-led impact.

Leadership in Event Management – ISTE MBCET
As the Sub-Lead of Event Management of the ISTE chapter at MBCET, I was directly involved in the planning and conduct of a number of influential events. Among these was Novatos 2025, a signature orientation and engagement initiative for freshman students. My tasks included management of logistics, coordination of sub-teams, and ensuring effective execution of several event segments. The activity involved attendance by more than [insert approximate number] students and was commended for its energy and organization. My leadership facilitated a friendly and participatory atmosphere for newcomers as well as promoted ISTE's presence and image on campus.

#### Networking:
In addition to face-to-face leadership, I have established a professional network of more than 1000 LinkedIn connections with students, faculty members, industry experts, and alumni. I leverage the network to remain informed, contribute knowledge, and connect others with prospects. It demonstrates my active attitude towards building relationships and staying current with my profession.

These experiences demonstrate my capacity to lead with initiative, influence through connection, and have a positive impact in professional and academic settings.

#### Career Plan:
Immediate Plans:

Encouraging Financial Viability in AI and Robotics Startups:
Short-term, I intend to work with AI and robotics startups to educate them on the financial matters important for expansion, such as cost control, raising capital, and profitability models. I intend to arrange focused workshops that address the financial issues unique to tech startups and offer solutions to minimize operational expenses while expanding. This will be achieved through collaborations with incubators, accelerators, and local startups, emphasizing hands-on, real-world financial guidance for entrepreneurs in AI and robotics.

Connecting AI/Robotics Startups with Investors and Funding:
One of my immediate objectives is to link AI and robotics startups in Kerala with potential investors, both from local angel investors and venture capital firms. I will coordinate pitch events, through which startups can pitch their ideas and financials to investors. I'll also organize investment-readiness workshops, assisting startups in preparing their financials and projections for funding opportunities, which is usually difficult for early-stage tech ventures.

Mentoring Startups on Financial and Technical Synergies:
My short-term objective is to mentor early-stage startups that incorporate AI or robotics into their business models. I will not only offer advice on business and financial strategy but also on the technical side of product development. I will help these startups create financial models that are aligned with their AI or robotics innovation while ensuring sustainability and scalability in their operations.

Long-Term Plans:

Creating a System of Financial Support for AI and Robotics Startups:
In the long term, I aim to build a financial support mechanism exclusively for AI and robotics startups in Kerala. This would mean establishing an ecosystem where such startups have access not just to funding but also to financial knowledge specifically suited to the specific requirements of high-tech companies. This mechanism would provide financial training, grant facilitation, and business mentoring, enabling startups to scale up sustainably without sacrificing financial stability.

Creating an AI and Robotics Innovation Fund:
I see establishing or co-establishing a focused venture fund that particularly invests in AI and robotics technologies in Kerala. The objective would be to deliver seed capital to new technology startups and also provide strategic advice on accounting. The fund would look to fill the funding gap for robotics and AI-based solutions, enabling innovative startups to turn their visions into reality and scale across the globe.

Forming Strategic Alliances Among AI/Robotics Startups and International Investors:
In the long run, I intend to enable cross-border collaborations between Kerala's AI and robotics startups and international investors. Through this, I aim to secure international funding, knowledge transfer, and market access. This would entail the establishment of global pitch events, collaborations with international AI/robotics networks, and organizing international investors in Kerala's startup ecosystem. This will allow Kerala's startups to receive global exposure and break geographical barriers.

Championing Policies to Promote AI and Robotics Innovation:
I shall closely collaborate with policymakers to lobby for policies fostering AI and robotics in Kerala in terms of money, research fund allocations, and start-up subsidies for these initiatives. I strive to establish an enabling environment to foster both technical innovation and economic viability so that Kerala's ecosystem for AI and robotics continues to remain competitive worldwide.

Sustaining the Growth of Kerala’s AI and Robotics Sector:
In the long run, I would like Kerala to be an international hub of AI and robotics innovation. This involves establishing sustainable growth pathways, interdisciplinary collaborations, and ensuring that financial operations are aligned with technological progress. I will work towards scaling up local tech skills and making these startups have the support and mentorship necessary to develop sustainable, globally competitive products.

#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem:

Kerala can lead the technology startup environment by establishing intense industry-academia interfaces, investing in education on AI and robotics, and developing a nurturing financial environment for budding startups. Kerala can lure international investment by promoting AI-based and sustainable technology solutions. By opening up mentorship programs, innovation accelerators, and funding schemes, Kerala can establish a strong tech community. Building on its strengths in social impact and sustainability, the state can position itself as a leader in tech for good and green tech and become an attractive place for talent and investors globally to drive long-term technology growth.

#### History of Open Source Contributions:

 While I don't have a lot of experience with open-source contributions yet, I've made a significant step by developing a gyroscope using Arduino, which I will be sharing with the open-source community in the near future. Here's how I intend to contribute in the future:

Gyroscope Project (Arduino):
I have created an Arduino gyroscope, which is applicable for motion detection, gesture recognition, robot navigation, and orientation sensing.

I intend to post this project on GitHub with the code, circuit diagrams, and setup instructions, making it possible for others to duplicate, adapt, and extend the project for application in robotics or interactive systems.

#### Highly Visible Technical Content:
I blog on Medium on themes which dig deep into the intriguing overlap of economics, international trends, and the future of learning. In my writings, I cover issues such as tariffs, the Big Mac Index, and how MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses) can change education.

I discuss how tariffs influence global trade and economies, how the Big Mac Index creates a fun and informative method for comparing currencies, and how MOOCs are transforming learning with quality education that is accessible globally. Through them, I share ideas that pose questions on how these factors make our world go round.
